Repository of a Pokemon-themed Discord bot

## Description
A Javascript Discord-bot based on a Pokemon-theme. The bot allows a server's users to play a basic version of a Pokemon themed game. The game is still in development, but should be finished before summer. 

Javascript was chosen as the programming language as it is user friendly, and establishing a connection between Javascript and Discord is fast and easy. Javascript is also the language in which we have the most collective experience.
