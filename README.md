# Pokebot
![alt text](PokeballsRender2.png)

## Description 📖
A JavaScript Discord-bot based on a Pokémon-theme. The bot allows a server's users to play a basic version of a Pokémon themed game. The game is still in development, but should be finished before summer. 

JavaScript was chosen as the programming language as it is user friendly, and establishing a connection between JavaScript and Discord is fast and easy. JavaScript is also the language in which we have the most collective experience.

## Installation 🖥️
You can add the bot to your server with [this](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=820940340239794176&permissions=0&scope=bot) link. Alternatively, you can clone this repo and host the bot yourself.
```
git clone https://github.com/ReinhardtR/pokebot.git
```
After cloning run:
```
npm install
```
to snag all of the dependencies. Of course, you need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. To optimize testing, this [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is also recommended.
