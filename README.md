# Pokebot
![alt text](PokeballsRender2.png)

## Description
A JavaScript Discord-bot based on a Pokémon-theme. The bot allows a server's users to play a basic version of a Pokémon themed game. The game is still in development, but should be finished before summer. 

JavaScript was chosen as the programming language as it is user friendly, and establishing a connection between JavaScript and Discord is fast and easy. JavaScript is also the language in which we have the most collective experience.
